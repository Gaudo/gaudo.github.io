<p>
    By being an information technology enthusiast, over the time I aquired many of my current skills both by work and passion.
    I mostly specialize in programming but I also have deep knowledge about computer science in general.
</p>
<p>
    As a programmer, although Iâ€™m more inclined towards backend development, I also have quite a lot of experience in frontend development.
    Favourite languages: Almost any strongly typed languages. Currently learning pure functional language structures.
